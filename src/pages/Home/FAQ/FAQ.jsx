              All the cars listed on our site are Car Dealer-certified, which
              means they have no history of major accidents, flood damage, or
              fire. Every car comes with an inspection report, so you can see if
              it has any minor flaws or not. If it does, we will also include
              pictures of the flaw so you can decide for yourself. Therefore,
              the Car Dealer certified inspection report is evidence that the
              vehicle has not been in any significant accidents and is in
              excellent condition for a road test.
